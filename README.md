# JavaScript NaN Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function designed to handle different data types. The function generally works correctly but fails to explicitly handle `NaN` values, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function attempts to convert various input types to strings. It correctly handles `null`, `undefined`, numbers, and objects. However, it doesn't explicitly check for `NaN`, which is a special numeric value representing "Not a Number".

The issue is that the `toString()` method applied to `NaN` returns the string "NaN", which is not always desirable.  A more robust approach would involve explicit checking for `NaN`. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding a specific check for `NaN` within the function to handle this edge case appropriately and improve the function's reliability.
